# Paging Library Architecture Component Demo

This project contains a sample of using the [Paging Library Architecture Component](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/) by way of a simple Notes app--no domain knowledge needed to understand the purpose of this app.

## Functionality

## Design Pattern
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is used to make the architecture cleaner, more readable and maintainable. Notes are stored and managed in memory within the domain layer (this sample is about Navigation and not full-blown [Clean Architecture](https://github.com/jshvarts/ConductorMVP) after all).
